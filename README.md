# CIA-Country-Analysis

## Code

## Context
CIA's The World Factbook represents the basic realities about the world in which we live in and is one of the U.S. Governmentâ€™s most accessed publications. It is used by a wide variety of audience including researchers, news organizations, corporations, geographers, travelers, professors and students as a one stop reference site. 

K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Machine Learing algorithm that groups unlabeled data points into clusters. It is an iterative algorithm that assigns data points to clusters based on their distance from the cluster's centroid. The centroid is the mean or median of all the points in the cluster. The number of clusters is provided as a hyperparameter before initiaing the algorithm.

The goal of this exercise is to gain insights into similarities between countries and regions of the world by experimenting with different cluster amounts and understand what these clusters represents. 

This exercise was provided as part of the excellent course 'Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass' by Jose Portilla on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/), which I completed.
